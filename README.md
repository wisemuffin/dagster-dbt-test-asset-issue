# Intro

This is an example of how to use the Software-Defined Asset APIs alongside Modern Data Stack tools
(specifically, Airbyte and dbt).

# Setup

## Python

To install this example and its python dependencies, run:

```
$ pip install -e .
```

Once you've done this, you can run:

```
$ dagit -m modern_data_stack_assets
```

To view this example in Dagster's UI, Dagit.

If you try to kick off a run immediately, it will fail, as there is no source data to ingest/transform, nor is there an active Airbyte connection. To get everything set up properly, read on.

## Local Postgres

To keep things running on a single machine, we'll use a local postgres instance as both the source and the destination for our data. You can imagine the "source" database as some online transactional database, and the "destination" as a data warehouse (something like Snowflake).

To get a postgres instance with the required source and destination databases running on your machine, you can run:

```
$ docker pull postgres
$ docker run --name mds-demo -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres
$ PGPASSWORD=password psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE postgres_replica;"
```

## Airbyte

Now, you'll want to get Airbyte running locally. The full instructions can be found [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/local-deployment), but if you just want to run some commands (in a separate terminal):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git
$ cd airbyte
$ docker-compose up
```

Once you've done this, you should be able to go to http://localhost:8000, and see Airbyte's UI.

## Data and Connections

Now, you'll want to seed some data into the empty database you just created, and create an Airbyte connection between the source and destination databases.

There's a script provided that should handle this all for you, which you can run with:

```
$ python -m modern_data_stack_assets.setup_airbyte
```

At the end of this output, you should see something like:

```
Created Airbyte Connection: c90cb8a5-c516-4c1a-b243-33dfe2cfb9e8
```

This connection id is specific to your local setup, so you'll need to update `constants.py` with this
value. Once you've update your `constants.py` file, you're good to go!
